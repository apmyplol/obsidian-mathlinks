# obsidian mathlinks

This is a plugin that enables links in obsidian math blocks.
The usage is `\href{file}{math}` where `file` is the file to be referenced and `math` is the equation that should be a link. See also  https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/html.html.

The links function the same way as obsidian links, i.e. they show a popup when hovered and are clickable.
